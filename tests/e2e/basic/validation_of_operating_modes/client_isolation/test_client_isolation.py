Testplan:
Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only with in the same SSID, Thereby
adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID. However, we are able
to ping the Stations from other SSIDâ€™s

Any user knowing the Password to the SSID can connect to network and gain the privileges
with in the network. If the user is a malicious user it is a threat to other users in
the same network. Client isolation feature isolates every client connected to the SSID
adding a level of security against attacks and threats to others users in the same SSID.

In this Test plan we have covered various scenarios and test working of the feature.
