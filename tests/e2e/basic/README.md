# wlan-testing framework Information

### e2e/basic

#### Basic test environment has 1 Access Point, 1 Cloud Controller, and 1 Candela LANforge Unit.

### Setup

There are 3 different Configuration Modes in an Access Point
1. Bridge   
2. NAT
3. VLAN

####Any one mode of setup can be done in an Access Point at a time.
#### Within each mode, n number of SSID's can be provisioned from the controller to the AP


setup will take the inputs from the Test cases

Test cases can be bunched on a
1. class level (have a module/ test_xx.py , have one or more classes, do setup once for each class)
2. function level   (have a module/ test_xx.py , have one or more functions, do setup once for each function)

##General Guardrails: 
```
setup_profile is a Fixture that collects markers 
from the test case to decide which security modes and band is need to be applied on the Access Point

Test cases can be selected based upon the markers 

# This selection will push all the config for the above scenario, considering that you have specified all required markers
pytest -m featureA

# This selection will select only wpa test cases and will push the config for wpa mode only because wpa2_personal marker is not selected
pytest -m "featureA and wpa"

Conclusion: Security modes for SSID has some specific markers which are specified as follows

open/wpa/wpa2_personal/wpa3_personal/wpa3_personal_mixed/wpa_wpa2_personal_mixed
wpa_enterprise/wpa2_enterprise/wpa3_enterprise/wpa_wpa2_enterprise_mixed/wpa3_enterprise_mixed/wep

and for band, its (twog/fiveg)

if you don't specifi the marker, then no matter what profile_config you are passing to setup_profile fixture,
it will not be pushed

Refer other test cases for more reference
