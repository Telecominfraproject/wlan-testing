## TIP Open WiFi Test Automation

### Overview

This repository contains the test automation framework and scripts for TIP Open WiFi.
Test Framework is implemented in pytest

![Automation Overview](.img/automation_overview.png)

The vision is to create an open test framework to ensure production grade Open Wifi Solution.

This test automation tied into our overall tooling at TIP as shown below:

![Tools and Test Automation](.img/Tools_and_Testing.png)

You can get the full list of tests on [GitHub Pages](https://telecominfraproject.github.io/wlan-testing/) that's updated automatically.

### General guidelines

This testing code adheres to generic [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction) style guidelines, most notably:

1. [Documentation strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings)
2. [Naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions)
3. [Sphynx docstring format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)

Using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) as the test execution framework.

Using [pylint](http://pylint.pycqa.org) for code quality monitoring.

We are using the `pylint` package to do the linting. Documentation for it can be found [here](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
In general, the customizations are possible via the `.pylintrc` file:

1. Line length below 120 characters is fine (search for max-line-length)
2. No new line at the end of file is fine (search for missing-final-newline)
3. Multiple new lines at the end of file are fine (search for trailing-newlines)
4. Indent using 4 spaces (search for indent-string)

In future we should enforce a policy, where we cannot merge a code where the pylint scoe goes below 7:

```shell
pylint --fail-under=7 *py
```

the command above would produce a non-zero exit code if the score drops below 7.

### TIP Controller Integration

Using Swagger Autogenerated CloudSDK Library pypi package (implemented with [swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)).

### Reporting

Currently we use the [pytest allure integration](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_pytest) to create visual reports for the test outcomes.

Additionally we generate overview pages, e.g. like [this one](http://openwifi-allure-reports.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sanity/overview/) to consolidate multiple test reports of the same test type.

These overview pages are being deployed by [this workflow](.github/workflows/update-overviews.yml) and their configuration is set in [this file](./.allure-overview/overviews.json).

### Miscellaneous

1. Do not use old style string formatting: `"Hello %s" % var`; use `f"Hello {var}` instead
2. use `"""` in Docstrings

### Best Practice

1. Ensure to have a python version > 3
2. We strongly recommend to use virtualenv to ensure that your dev environment sandbox is created.

### Code style

All code must be written in python 3 and conform to PEP 8 style guide. The test framework is built using pytest.
