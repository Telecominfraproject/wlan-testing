            Test Description:
            Airtime Fairness Test intends to verify the capability of Wi-Fi device to ensure the fairness of airtime usage.
            This test uses two stations at a time, with one station running in optimum configuration. The second station
            varies between optimum configuration, weaker signal, and legacy mode configurations. In each setting,
            TCP traffic is used to determine maximum capacity of each station running by itself. Then, UDP traffic is
            created on STA1 to run at 75% of the TCP throughput and UDP traffic is created on the second station at
            50% of the TCP throughput for that station. This overdrives the AP and causes it to drop frames. The
            pass/fail criteria is that each station gets at least 45% of the TCP throughput when both stations are
            running the prescribed UDP traffic.

            Marker:
            advance_ac and atf and wpa2_personal and bridge

            Note: Please refer to the PDF report for the Test Procedure, Pass/Fail Criteria, and Candela Score.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation enabled on both, 2.4GHz and 5GHz) are not isolated when
        traffic is run from 2.4GHz client to 5GHz client.

        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the endpoints (a station and a wan port)

            Test Description:
            Spatial consistency test intends to verify the Wi-Fi signal consistency in spatial
            domain by testing throughput with DUT at different angles to the Station and at different
            emulated distance. The angles are changed with a programmable turn-table.
            The distance is emulated by adjusting attenuation.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the same SSID
        (with client isolation disabled) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 5GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the endpoints (a station and a wan port)
        (with client isolation enabled) are not isolated when
        the station is on 5GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation enabled on both) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 2.4GHz band.

            Test Description:
            Airtime Fairness Test intends to verify the capability of Wi-Fi device to ensure the fairness of airtime usage.
            This test uses two stations at a time, with one station running in optimum configuration. The second station
            varies between optimum configuration, weaker signal, and legacy mode configurations. In each setting,
            TCP traffic is used to determine maximum capacity of each station running by itself. Then, UDP traffic is
            created on STA1 to run at 75% of the TCP throughput and UDP traffic is created on the second station at
            50% of the TCP throughput for that station. This overdrives the AP and causes it to drop frames. The
            pass/fail criteria is that each station gets at least 45% of the TCP throughput when both stations are
            running the prescribed UDP traffic.

            Marker:
            advance_ax and atf and wpa2_personal and bridge

            Note: Please refer to the PDF report for the Test Procedure, Pass/Fail Criteria, and Candela Score.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation disabled on both) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 5GHz band.

            Test Description:
            The Maximum throughput test intends to measure the maximum throughput performance of the DUT with
            a single station active. The test uses TCP connections and the attenuation is adjusted to emulate a
            distance of 2 meters. The 2.4Ghz station is configured for 20Mhz bandwidth and the 5Ghz station is
            configured for 80Mhz bandwidth. In 6Ghz, the station is configured for 160Mhz bandwidth. In both cases
            the station is configured for a maximum of two spatial streams.

            Marker:

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation enabled on A and disabled on B) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 5GHz band.

        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the same SSID
        (with client isolation enabled) are isolated when
        both the clients are on 5GHz band.

            Test Description:
            Receiver Sensitivity is a receiver's ability to receive and correctly demodulate weak signals.
            This test provides a simplified measurement of the receiver's sensitivity, relative to the total
            attenuation inserted between the DUT and the STA. As that attenuation is increased, the STA is
            limited to a single coding scheme, eventually causing the connection to degrade.
            The point at which the connection degrades represents the receiver's approximate sensitivity.
            This is an approximate measurement only, where a detailed receiver sensitivity measurement would
            typically be performed in a conducted test environment with calibrated transmitter power levels.
            The test is repeated with multiple coding schemes, ensuring the DUT should smoothly
            transition between coding schedules as the attenuation increases in normal operation.

            Marker:
            advance_ac and rx_sensitivity_tests and wpa2_personal and bridge

            Note: Please refer to the PDF report for the Test Procedure, Pass/Fail Criteria, and Candela Score.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation enabled on both) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 5GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the same SSID
        (with client isolation enabled) are isolated when
        both the clients are on 2.4GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the endpoints (a station and a wan port)
        (with client isolation enabled) are not isolated when
        the station is on 2.4GHz band.

            Test Description:
            Range versus rate test intends to measure the rate-control,
            baseband and RF chain performance of Wi-Fi device at different signal levels.
            The attenuation of signals due to range increase is achieved by
            adjusting the attenuator.

            Marker:

            Test Description:
            Spatial consistency test intends to verify the Wi-Fi signal consistency in spatial
            domain by testing throughput with DUT at different angles to the Station and at different
            emulated distance. The angles are changed with a programmable turn-table.
            The distance is emulated by adjusting attenuation.

            Test Description:
            Receiver Sensitivity is a receiver's ability to receive and correctly demodulate weak signals.
            This test provides a simplified measurement of the receiver's sensitivity, relative to the total
            attenuation inserted between the DUT and the STA. As that attenuation is increased, the STA is
            limited to a single coding scheme, eventually causing the connection to degrade.
            The point at which the connection degrades represents the receiver's approximate sensitivity.
            This is an approximate measurement only, where a detailed receiver sensitivity measurement would
            typically be performed in a conducted test environment with calibrated transmitter power levels.
            The test is repeated with multiple coding schemes, ensuring the DUT should smoothly
            transition between coding schedules as the attenuation increases in normal operation.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation disabled on both) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 2.4GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation disabled on both, 2.4GHz and 5GHz) are not isolated when
        traffic is run from 5GHz client to 2.4GHz client.

            The Maximum throughput test intends to measure the maximum throughput performance of the DUT with
            a single station active. The test uses TCP connections and the attenuation is adjusted to emulate a
            distance of 2 meters. The 2.4Ghz station is configured for 20Mhz bandwidth and the 5Ghz station is
            configured for 80Mhz bandwidth. In 6Ghz, the station is configured for 160Mhz bandwidth. In both cases
            the station is configured for a maximum of two spatial streams.

        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the same SSID
        (with client isolation disabled) are not isolated when
        both the clients are on 2.4GHz band.

        Description:
        Client Isolation is feature that isolates clients only within the same SSID,
        Thereby adding level of security to the users connected to the same SSID.
        However, we are able to ping the Stations from other SSIDs.

        This testcase is to verify that the clients connected to the different SSIDs
        (with client isolation disabled on both, 2.4GHz and 5GHz) are not isolated when
        traffic is run from 2.4GHz client to 5GHz client.
